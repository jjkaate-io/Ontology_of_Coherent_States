# Ontology of Coherent States  
## Limit of Distinguishability and the Structure of Physical Reality

This repository contains the fixed version (v1.0) of the conceptual paper  
**“Ontology of Coherent States: Limit of Distinguishability and the Structure of Physical Reality.”**

The work proposes an ontological framework in which physical reality is described not as a collection of independent entities, forces, or fields, but as a coherent system of admissible states and transitions between them.

The concept introduces a fundamental limit of distinguishability (Δ) as a structural constraint of reality itself, from which time, geometry, gravitation, quantum discreteness, entropy, and interactions emerge as derived phenomena.

This repository serves as a **temporal anchor** for the idea: a fixed reference point for authorship, versioning, and further conceptual development.

## Scope and Intent

This work does **not** propose a new physical theory, mathematical formalism, or experimental model.  
It is fully compatible with established physical theories, including general relativity and quantum mechanics.

Its purpose is ontological clarification:  
to provide a unified conceptual framework in which existing theories appear as coherent manifestations of a shared underlying structure.

## Author’s Note

This repository is intended as a starting point for reflection and dialogue,  
not as a definitive conclusion.

The concept is offered to the scientific and philosophical community  
as an invitation to think, test, and reinterpret — not as a claim of final truth, but as a coherent proposal open to scrutiny, reinterpretation, and refinement.


## Versioning note:

The English version (v1.0.0 EN) is a translation of the Russian v1.0.1 document.
No conceptual changes were introduced.
